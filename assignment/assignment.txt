1.what is javascript?
javascript is a high level programming language mainly used to make
web pages interactive and dynamic
javascript=behavior(logic+interaction)


2. Who developed JavaScript, and what is the first name of JavaScript? 
JavaScript was developed by brendan eich in 1995.
It was originally called mocha then renamed to livescript,
finally renamed to javascript


3. Are ECMAScript and javascript related? How? 
JavaScript is the practical language, and ECMAScript is the standard 
that defines how JavaScript should work.


4. Is JavaScript case-sensitive? 
Yes, It treats uppercase and lowercase as different


5. What are the different data types present in javascript? 
javascript has 8 datatypes. They are divided into primitive and non primitive
primitive:
        These store single values and are immutable
    string,number,bigint,boolean,undefined,null,symbol
Non-primitive:
    object: key-value pairs{name:'avi,course:'python}


6. What do you mean by NULL in JavaScript? 
null is a primitive data type that represents an intentional empty value
It means this variable has no value right now, and I am intentionally
setting it empty right now

let user=null
console.log(user) // null
let a; 
console.log(a) // undefined


7. What do you mean by undefined value in JavaScript? 
A variable has been declared but no value assigned yet
let age;
console.log(age);


8. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators. 
== loose equality : compares values only (peforms type conversion)
===strict equality : compares data types and values

console.log(5=='5') // true
console.log(5==='5') // false

console.log(true==1) // true
console.log(true===1) // false


9. What do you mean by the “===” operator? 
===strict equality : compares data types and values(no type conversion)


10. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript. 
Both are used to declare variables but
var - function scoped
let - block scoped
if (true) {
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
}

console.log(a); // ✅ 10
console.log(b); // ❌ Error (b is block scoped)
let stays inside block
var ignores block scoped

var can be redclared
let can't be redclared in same scope
var x = 5;
var x = 10;  // ✅ allowed

let y = 5;
let y = 10;  // ❌ Error

Both are hoisted, but differently :
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 5;


10b. let vs const
Both are block scoped but they differ in mutability
Reassignment:
let can be reassigned
const can't be reassigned

let age = 25;
age = 30;   // ✅ allowed

const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.1415;  // ❌ Error

Declaration :
let can declare without initializing
const must initialize at Declaration
let a;        // ✅ allowed

const b;      // ❌ Error

object and array behavior :
const prevents reassignment,not modification
const arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3);   // ✅ allowed


11. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
Implicit type Coercion means javascript automatically converts datatype 
into another without you explicitly telling you to do so.
console.log(5+'5');  // 55 (num+num=num;num+str=str)
console.log('5'+5+5); // 555
console.log(5+5+'5');  ///105

console.log('10'-2);  // 8 (str converted automatically into num)
console.log('20'-3-5); // 12 
console.log(15-'3'-3-'3'); // 6


console.log(5*2); // 10
console.log(5*'2'); // 10
console.log('5'*2);  // 10
console.log('5'*'2');  // 10
console.log('5'*2*'10'*3+"2"); // 3002
console.log('5'*2*'10'*3+2);  //302


console.log(5==='5'); // false
console.log(5=='5');  // true

console.log(true+1); // 2
console.log(true+false); // 1
console.log('true'+1);  // true1
console.log(1+'true'); // 1true


console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log(null == undefined); // true

12. What is NaN property in JavaScript?
NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value that is not 
a valid number, even though its type is number
console.log('hello'*5) // NaN
console.log(typeof NaN) // number (even though it means NaN, its type in number)
console.log(NaN==NaN) // false
console.log(NaN===NaN) // false
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN));  // true


13. What Should be the answer of 10+2+'77'
console.log(10+2+'77'); // 1277

14. what is the use of the delete operator?
The delete operator is used to remove a property from an object
let person={
  name:'avi',
  age : 25
}

delete person.age; // The age property is completely deleted

console.log(person);

let arr=[10,20,30,40]
delete arr[2]  // don't use delete for array elements it gives empty item use splice
console.log(arr);

let nums=[1,2,3,4,5]
nums.splice(2,1)  // use splice to delete an element from an array
console.log(nums)


15. what do you mean by escape characters ?
Escape characters are special characters used inside strings to represent things 
that are difficult or impossible to type directly.
They start with a backslash\
console.log('hello\navinash');
console.log('hello\tavinash')
console.log("\"India\" is my country");
console.log("India's my country")
console.log('India\'s my country')


16. Name all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
alert()

and are sent to the server with every http request


18. How to create a cookie in javascript?
In JavaScript we create cookie using document.cookie
document.cookie="username=Avinash"; // it will expire when you close browser
document.cookie = "username=Avinash; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2026 12:00:00 UTC";
If you don’t set expiry, it becomes a session cookie (deleted when browser closes).
